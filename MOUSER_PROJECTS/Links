These are the mouser projects I used for the assembly of the final prototypes. They will give you a good starting point to create your own cart.

!!! Please note !!!

→ Quantities have been set to my personal needs (mostly twice as much)
→ The projects are all dated from 2018, but still might contain not available/ obsolete parts
→ The projects are not maintained
→ Amendments in the BOMs have not been transcribed to the projects
→ The projects are not exhaustive!

I urgently recommend to check with the BOMs before ordering!

Please feel free to post your projects/carts. I will add these here.
