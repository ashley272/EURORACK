# ST MODULAR
_EURORACK DIY_

This repository was made to provide you with the neccessary information to source your parts and find their place on the PCB. There won´t be full build documentations available at any time in the future. 

If you have questions before or while building please join the [ST Modular Builders Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/stmodular/) on Facebook. There you will also find additional information about the builds in the "lessions" section.

I also recoomnd to fully read the "Eurorack Soldering Guide" available above. There I have described how I solder DIY projects step-by-step and I added a list of recommended tools and links that might be useful when jumping into Eurorack DIY.

If you got ST Modular PCBs you will need to solder 0603 packaged components. The PCBs are not necessarily designed to be builder friendly as there are very tiny components included (e.g. SOD-523 diodes). Therefore the modules are recommended to be soldered by experienced builders only. Successful construction, safe powering and necessary calibration of the module is purely your responsibility. You are solely responsible for ensuring the finished module will not damage other equipment that you connect it to. Damage to other equipment is your responsibility. I am not responsible if you injure yourself or others, or damage any of your property or others property during the construction or use of PCBs provided.

I do not offer or perform repairs of any type.
